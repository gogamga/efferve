I need you to create a detailed implementation plan. Follow this process:

1. Read CLAUDE.md and any SPEC.md or HANDOFF.md files if they exist
2. Explore the relevant parts of the codebase related to this task
3. Create a step-by-step implementation plan that includes:
   - Files to create or modify
   - Key implementation details for each step
   - Potential edge cases or risks
   - How to verify each step works

**DO NOT write any code yet.** Only output the plan.

Format the plan as a numbered checklist I can review and approve.
After I approve, I'll tell you to execute.
