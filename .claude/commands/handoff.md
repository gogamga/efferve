Create or update a HANDOFF.md file in the project root with:

1. **Goal:** What we were working on
2. **Current State:** What's been completed
3. **What Worked:** Approaches that succeeded
4. **What Didn't Work:** Approaches that failed (so the next session doesn't retry them)
5. **Next Steps:** Exactly what to do next, in order
6. **Key Context:** Any decisions, tradeoffs, or gotchas the next session needs to know

If a HANDOFF.md already exists, read it first and update it — don't overwrite.

This file should contain everything a fresh Claude Code session needs to
continue this work without any additional context from me.
